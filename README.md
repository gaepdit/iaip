# iaip.gaepd.org

This repository branch, `gh-pages`, is for the IAIP website which hosts the installation files plus some documentation. Application code and more information are on the [`main` branch](https://github.com/gaepdit/iaip).

## Build Instructions

The HTML files are generated from the Markdown (*.md) files in the "/docs" folder using the `build.bat` script. This requires that [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) be installed on your computer.
