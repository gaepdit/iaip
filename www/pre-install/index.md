## Notes

This page is only for installing the IAIP Prerequisites. These prerequisites only need to be installed once per machine, but must be installed with administrator permissions. (The [IAIP](../) is installed separately for each user.)


## Do I need this thing?

* Were you trying to install the IAIP and got a messages saying "Cannot continue. The application is improperly formattedâ€¦"?
* Or were you using the IAIP and got a message saying "You must install Crystal Reports in order to print reports"?

If so, then you have come to the right place! Otherwise, probably not (but it won't hurt anything if you install it anyway).
