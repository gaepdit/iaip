## Notes

This page is only for installing the IAIP Prerequisites. These prerequisites only need to be installed once per machine, but must be installed with administrator permissions. (The [IAIP](../) is installed separately for each user.)

## Do I need this thing?

* Were you using the IAIP and got a message saying "You must install Crystal Reports in order to print reports"?
* Or were you trying to install the IAIP and got a message saying "Unable to install or run the application" or "The application is improperly formattedâ€¦"?

If so, then you have come to the right place! Otherwise, probably not (but it won't hurt anything if you install it anyway).

## Did it work?

* If you got a message saying "IAIP prerequisites successfully installed," then it worked!

* If you got an error message saying "An error occurred while installing system components for IAIP Framework Installer...", then you don't have admin rights on your computer to complete the installation, and a technician will have to install the prerequisites for you. Please submit a ticket at the [EPD-IT Service Desk](https://gaepdit.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1).
