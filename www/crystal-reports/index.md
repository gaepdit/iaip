## Notes

Crystal Reports is only required if you need to view and print reports from the IAIP. If you tried to print or open a report in the IAIP and got an error message, this should fix it.

The software only needs to be installed once per machine and must be installed with administrator permissions.

If you get an error message while installing, the most common reason is that you don't have admin rights on your computer. Please [submit a support request ticket](https://gaepd.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360005194594) to resolve this.
