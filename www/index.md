## Support

For account creation or management, please speak to your supervisor in EPD or Sean Taylor. For general application support or to report a bug, please create an [EPD-IT Support Ticket](https://gaepd.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

Some additional documentation can be found on the [IAIP Documentation site](https://sites.google.com/site/iaipdocs/).

## Printing

If this is the first time the IAIP is being installed on your computer, you may also need to install the [IAIP Tools](../pre-install/) to enable printing.

## Connecting remotely

The IAIP may be used from remote locations (outside of EPD offices) *only* by connecting through the DNR VPN. [Instructions for accessing the VPN](https://dnrintranet.org/it/SSLvpn) are available on the DNR Intranet.

Your username and password for the VPN are the same as the ones you use to log in to your work computer (not the same as your IAIP username/password).

## Security alert

On Windows 10, you will likely get a security alert when you install the IAIP. Click the "More info" link, then click the button labeled "Run anyway".
