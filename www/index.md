## Support

For account creation or management, please speak to your supervisor in EPD. For general application support or to report a bug, please use the [EPD IT Service Desk](https://gaepdit.atlassian.net/servicedesk/).

Some additional documentation can be found on the [IAIP Documentation site](https://sites.google.com/site/iaipdocs/).

### Prerequistes

If this is the first time the IAIP is being installed on your computer, you may also need to install the [IAIP prerequisites](../pre-install/). This can also prevent some common errors.

### Connecting remotely

The IAIP may be used from remote locations (outside of EPD offices) *only* by connecting through the DNR VPN. [Instructions for accessing the VPN](https://dnrintranet.org/it/SSLvpn) are available on the DNR Intranet. For assistance, please use the [EPD IT Service Desk](https://gaepdit.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/create/34)

**All Air Branch and District employees have a VPN account.** Your username and password are the same as the ones you use to log in to your work computer (not the same as your IAIP username/password).


### Updates

The IAIP automatically checks for updates when it is run. If an update is available, a notification will be displayed.
