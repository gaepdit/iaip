## Introduction

In March 2014, we will be changing the method used to distribute and update the <abbr title="Integrated Air Information Platform">IAIP</abbr>.

### The Good News:

Installation will be just as easy as before (easier in most cases!), and future updates will be smaller to download and will install automatically.

### The Bad News:

Switching to the new system will require all current users of the IAIP to manually install the new version from scratch. Luckily, this is a <em>one-time process</em>, and after that, updates will be automatic.

## How to Install
