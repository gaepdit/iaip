[Download the 
IAIP Installer](setup.exe)

## Installation Instructions

These instructions are only for installing the IAIP for the first time. If you already have the IAIP installed, updates are handled from within the application.

1. ![User ID](screenshots/details-IAIP-userid.png)

    If you already use the IAIP, make note of your login User ID, then **close the IAIP** before you begin.

2. Click the big **`Download`** button above to download and run a file named `setup.exe`.

3. ![Example warning](screenshots/details-warning.png) 

    Along the way, you will get several notifications and prompts warning you that downloading and installing software from the Internet is dangerous and could harm your computer. *This is good advice!*

    In this case, though, it is safe to continue the installation.

4. ![Crystal Reports license agreement](screenshots/details-CR-license.png) 

    If you are asked to accept a license agreement for Crystal Reports, do so.

5. ![Application Install Security Warning](screenshots/details-install.png) 

    After Crystal Reports is installed, you will be asked again if you want to install the IAIP. Click `Install`.

6. ![IAIP login screen](screenshots/details-IAIP-final-circled.png) 

    When installation is completed, the IAIP should start, and the Login form should display **Version: 3.0.0** (or later). If you get this far, you're done! (Hopefully, you remember your User ID.)

7. The new IAIP will try to delete your old shortcuts, but if it can't, feel free to delete them yourself.
