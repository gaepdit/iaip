## Introduction

In March 2014, we will be changing the method used to distribute and update the <abbr title="Integrated Air Information Platform">IAIP</abbr>.

### The Good News:

Installation for new users will be just as easy as before (easier in most cases!), and future updates will install automatically.

### The Bad News:

Switching to the new system will require all current users to manually install the new version. Luckily, this is a <em>one-time event</em>; after that, updates will be automatic.

## Detailed Instructions

1. ![User ID](screenshots/details-IAIP-userid.png)

    If you already use the IAIP, make note of your login user ID, then **close the IAIP** before you begin.

2. ![Installation Page](screenshots/install-page.png)

    Go to the [Installation Page](IAIP-install.html) and click the `Install` button to download and run a file named `setup.exe`.

3. ![Example warning](screenshots/details-warning.png) 

    Along the way, you will get several notifications and prompts warning you that downloading and installing software from the Internet is dangerous and could harm your computer. *This is good advice!*

    In this case, though, it is safe to continue the installation.

4. ![Crystal Reports license agreement](screenshots/details-CR-license.png) 

    If you are asked to accept a license agreement for Crystal Reports, do so.

5. ![Application Install Security Warning](screenshots/details-install.png) 

    After Crystal Reports is installed, you will be asked again if you want to install the IAIP.

6. ![IAIP login screen](screenshots/details-IAIP-final-circled.png) 

    Finally, the IAIP should start, and the Login form should display **Version: 3.0.0** (or later). If you get this far, you're done!

7. The new IAIP will try to delete your old shortcuts, but if it can't, feel free to delete them yourself.
