## Introduction

In March 2014, we will be changing the method used to distribute and update the <abbr title="Integrated Air Information Platform">IAIP</abbr>.

### The Good News:

Installation will be just as easy as before (easier in most cases!), and future updates will install automatically.

### The Bad News:

Switching to the new system will require all current users to manually install the new version from scratch. Luckily, this is a <em>one-time event</em>. After that, updates will be automatic.

## Detailed Instructions

1. ![User ID](screenshots/details-IAIP-userid.png)

    Before you begin, make note of your login user ID, then **close the IAIP**.

2. ![Installation Page](screenshots/install-page.png)

    Go to the [Installation Page](IAIP-install.html) and click the `Install` button.

3. ![Example warning](screenshots/details-warning.png) 

    At this point, you will probably get several notifications from your brower and OS warning you that downloading and installing software from the Internet is dangerous and could harm your computer. This is good advice! 

    In this case, though, it is safe to continue the installation.

4. ![Crystal Reports license agreement](screenshots/details-CR-license.png) 

    If you are asked to accept the license agreement for Crystal Reports, click `Accept`.

5. ![Application Install Security Warning](screenshots/details-install.png) 

    After Crystal Reports is installed, you will be asked again if you want to install the IAIP.

6. ![IAIP login screen](screenshots/details-IAIP-final-circled.png) 

    If the IAIP starts and displays **Version: 3.0.0** (or later), you're done!

7. The new IAIP will try to delete your old shortcuts, but if it can't, feel free to delete them yourself.
