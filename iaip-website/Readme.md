# iaip.gaepd.org

This is the website for hosting the IAIP installation files plus some documentation.

## Editing Instructions

1. Edit or add new Markdown (*.md) files.

2. Generate HTML files from the Markdown files using the `build.bat` script. This requires that [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) be installed on your computer.

## Deployment Instructions

The website is hosted on GitHub Pages and is automatically deployed by the `deploy-application.yml` GitHub workflow when a new production version of the IAIP is deployed.
