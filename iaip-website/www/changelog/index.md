## Version 6.0.0 <span>(2022-03-24)</span>

ðŸ“„ The Crystal Reports plugin has been removed and replaced with a new reports generating app. Rather than opening in a stand-alone window, printable reports will now open in a web browser. From there, you can use the built-in browser tools to print the report or save it as a PDF file. Because each report exists as a separate web page, links to each report can be bookmarked and shared publicly.

As part of this change, installation of the IAIP printing tools is no longer required. This means it is no longer necessary to request admin rights to complete the IAIP setup. 

Another benefit of this change is that the size of the IAIP installation files has been reduced from over 60MB to less than 15MB, meaning updates will download more quickly.

## Version 5.27.1 <span>(2022-03-01)</span>

In this update, the PA/PN tool has been updated to use RTF files instead of PDF files.

## Version 5.27.0 <span>(2022-01-27)</span>

Events can be duplicated making it easier to create multiple events with the same details.

## Version 5.26.7 <span>(2022-01-19)</span>

This update restores the ability to copy a facility contact if it needs to be used for multiple contact types.

Additional info was added to one of the Emissions Inventory status tables.
